# Introduction to Data Analysis with Python

July 15-19, 2024

Instructor: Dr. M. Fuat Kına

We cordially invite you to participate in an enriching five-day in-person summer school aimed at providing social science researchers with essential skills in Python for data analysis. This educational event, entitled "Introduction to Data Analysis with Python," delivers extensive training in the fundamental elements of Python programming, effective data manipulation, and basic statistical analysis techniques. Attendees will be adeptly guided through the use of robust tools including Anaconda Navigator, Google Colab, Numpy, and Pandas, which are instrumental in augmenting their research proficiency. This summer school is ideal for social science researchers, and anyone interested in leveraging Python for data-driven research and analysis. 

## Key Benefits:

Understand the basics of Python programming and data structures.

Gain proficiency in data manipulation and visualization using Pandas and Matplotlib.

Apply basic statistical methods to real-world social science data. 

## Summer School Details:

Dates: July 15-19, 2024 / 10:00 AM to 3:00 PM

Location: Marmara University, Göztepe Campus

## Summer School Requirements

Language: The summer school will be conducted in both English and Turkish. Participants are required to have at least an upper-intermediate level of proficiency in both languages to fully engage with and benefit from the program.

Equipment: Each participant must bring their own laptop or computer equipped with Wi-Fi capability. This is essential for participation in hands-on activities and exercises throughout the summer school. Ensure your laptop is in good working order and that you are comfortable with using it for extended periods, as the summer school involves significant hands-on activity.

Software: Prior to the summer school, participants should install Anaconda Navigator and Google Colab on their laptops. Links to installation guides will be provided upon registration. 

Background: A very basic background in programming or data analysis is preferred, but not mandatory. The summer school is designed to accommodate beginners, with step-by-step guidance provided.

Note that graduate-level social science students and early career social science researchers will be given priority in the evaluation process. Undergraduate students in their third or fourth year of study are also eligible to apply.
